- 👋 Hi, I’m @Passer1072
- 👀 I’m interested in computer vision.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about YOLO-based computer vision techniques.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to computer vision.
- 📫 You can reach me via email at csy108729@gmail.com.
- 😄 Pronouns: PASSER.
- ⚡ Fun fact: At first, because the AI ​​assistance on the market was too expensive and unstable, I thought it would be better to write one myself, so I entered the field of computer AI vision. 😄  

纯萌新，希望各位大佬进行指点:)
